All widgets have been tested and are working on macOS Big Sur 11.1. 

For other versions you'll have to edit and adjust the widgets yourself (E.g. Battery widgets).

Widgets have been created in a way that they fit a 27" screen as a band on the left side of the screen. For smaller screens you can make adjustments within the widgets.

## 1. Clock
- Simple big clock 

## 2. Welcome message 
- Welcome message for the current user that adapts to the time of the day. E.g.  Good evening, good morning ...

## 3. Weather
